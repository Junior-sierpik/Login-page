### The HTML/CSS sign-up/log-in page project is a static web-based application that provides users with the ability to create accounts (sign-up) and authenticate themselves (log-in) using basic HTML forms and CSS styling.
### This project focuses on front-end development techniques without relying on JavaScript for interactivity.
